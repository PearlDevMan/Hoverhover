Delays on all hosts
...................

Let's apply a 2 seconds delay to all hosts. Save the following inside ``delays.json``:

.. literalinclude:: delays.json
   :language: json

Now run the following:

.. literalinclude:: delays.sh
   :language: json

Notice the 2 seconds delay on the curl command.
