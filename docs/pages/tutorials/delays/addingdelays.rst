Adding delays to a simulation
-----------------------------

Simulating latency during development enables you to write code that'll deal with it gracefully. In Hoverfly, this is done with a json file.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 3
    
    allhosts/allhosts
    multiplehosts/multiplehosts
    multiplelocations/multiplelocations
    multiplematches/multiplematches
