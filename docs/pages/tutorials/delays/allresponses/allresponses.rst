Applying a delay to all responses
=================================

Let's apply a 2 second delay to all responses. Save the following inside ``delays.json``:

.. literalinclude:: delays.json
   :language: javascript

Now run the following:

.. literalinclude:: delays.sh
   :language: sh

Notice the 2 second delay on the response.
